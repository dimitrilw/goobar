# imports

`goobar/imports` is a collection of misc stuff that would usually be imported. 
However, this repo is designed for copy-paste into environments where import of 
public packages is not permitted.

It is named "imports" and not "import" because "import" is a reserved word in Go.

Also, I am trying to be a good steward and respect the source of the code I am 
placing here as reference material. I am not trying to pass off the `imports` 
code as my own. I am trying to give credit where credit is due. I am trying to 
make it easy to find the source of the code. I am trying to make it easy 
to find the license of the code.
